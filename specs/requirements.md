# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) application provides a streamlined solution for document upload, processing, and analysis. The system performs OCR extraction, document classification, and summarization in a sequential pipeline, storing results in a flexible database schema and presenting them through a simple web interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Document Upload Interface
**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload documents through a simple web interface, so that I can process them through the IDP pipeline.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a user accesses the web application THE SYSTEM SHALL display a simple file upload interface
2. WHEN a user selects a document file THE SYSTEM SHALL validate the file type and size
3. WHEN a user uploads a valid document THE SYSTEM SHALL store it in AWS S3 and trigger the IDP pipeline
4. WHEN a document upload is successful THE SYSTEM SHALL display a confirmation message with processing status

### Requirement 2: OCR Processing
**User Story:** As a system, I want to extract text content from uploaded documents as key-value pairs, so that structured data can be obtained for further processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a document is uploaded to S3 THE SYSTEM SHALL trigger OCR processing using AWS Textract
2. WHEN OCR processing completes THE SYSTEM SHALL extract content as key-value pairs in JSON format
3. WHEN the extracted content contains markdown-wrapped JSON THE SYSTEM SHALL handle it correctly
4. WHEN OCR processing fails THE SYSTEM SHALL log the error and update the processing status

### Requirement 3: Document Classification
**User Story:** As a system, I want to classify documents into predefined categories, so that documents can be organized and processed appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN OCR processing completes successfully THE SYSTEM SHALL perform document classification
2. WHEN classifying a document THE SYSTEM SHALL use the available categories: Dietary Supplement, Stationery, Kitchen Supplies, Medicine, Driver License, Invoice, W2, Other
3. WHEN classification completes THE SYSTEM SHALL store the result with confidence score
4. WHEN classification fails THE SYSTEM SHALL assign "Other" category and log the error

### Requirement 4: Document Summarization
**User Story:** As a system, I want to generate summaries of processed documents, so that users can quickly understand document content.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN document classification completes successfully THE SYSTEM SHALL perform document summarization
2. WHEN generating a summary THE SYSTEM SHALL use the OCR extracted text as input
3. WHEN summarization completes THE SYSTEM SHALL store the generated summary
4. WHEN summarization fails THE SYSTEM SHALL log the error and continue processing

### Requirement 5: Results Storage and Display
**User Story:** As a user, I want to view the processing results for my uploaded documents, so that I can access the extracted information, classification, and summary.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN all IDP tasks complete THE SYSTEM SHALL store results in a flexible schema database
2. WHEN processing is complete THE SYSTEM SHALL display OCR results, classification, and summary in the web interface
3. WHEN a user refreshes the page THE SYSTEM SHALL show the current processing status
4. WHEN processing fails at any stage THE SYSTEM SHALL display appropriate error messages

### Requirement 6: End-to-End Processing
**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to process documents through all three stages automatically, so that I receive complete analysis without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a document is uploaded THE SYSTEM SHALL execute OCR, classification, and summarization in sequence
2. WHEN any processing stage fails THE SYSTEM SHALL continue with remaining stages where possible
3. WHEN all processing completes THE SYSTEM SHALL update the user interface with final results
4. WHEN processing is in progress THE SYSTEM SHALL show appropriate loading indicators
